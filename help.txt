How It Works
HTML Structure: The Tic-Tac-Toe board is created using a grid of div elements. There are buttons for resetting the game and a display area for the status.

CSS Styling: The board and cells are styled to be visually appealing, with hover effects on the cells.

JavaScript Functionality:

handleCellClick(): Handles clicks on the cells, updates the game state, and checks for a winner.
checkForWinner(): Checks if the current player has won or if the game is a draw.
resetGame(): Resets the game to its initial state.
Usage
You can copy and paste the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into your respective files to see the Tic-Tac-Toe game in action. Enjoy playing and modifying the game!
